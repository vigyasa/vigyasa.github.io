									<p>21st century require skills such as collaboration, communication, creativity, and critical thinking (4C’s), that are very important, combined with computational thinking.
									Robots in their various forms are increasingly accepted as technological tools used in classrooms to teach students about Science, Technology and Mathematics as they encourage both teachers and the students to communicate their ideas and understanding, creating a more collaborative classroom.
 									The LEGO® robotics platform has been well established in education for over 20 years, but unfortunately, not in India. LEGO allows students to construct a robot with the use of LEGO blocks, sensors and motors. The LEGO platform is commercially available and programmable through drag and drop software or RobotC code, which is quite simple.
									The idea of introducing basic and simple robotics to students dawned upon the team of Vigyasa, when I realized that I myself had spent numerous hours working on the blocks and sensors at a very young age, and have also implemented its use in a number of projects, most significantly in our science exhibitions, held at school. 
									</p>
									<p>So we introduced the basic hardware such as the sensors, the servo motors and then programming to the students, in the first session.
									In  the later sessions, we explained the basic fashioning of the models using a few basic projects, such as the 'Two-minute Bot'. Once the students had a basic idea of the kit, they formed groups and were allowed to work with it. The  students found the robots to be very engaging and it sparked their interest in coding and robotics. Some of the students also planned to group together and buy the kit after the complete introduction, We could thus conclude having successfully completed our goal.
									</p>
									<p>Being able to code and problem-solve with robotics and other technologies are important 21st century skills that need to be developed
									The three of us found an increase in student engagement, differentiation of student learning, self directed learning, deep learning, and a fostering of the 4Cs (creativity, collaboration, communication, and critical thinking). These transformative classroom practices enable students to use the technology in ubiquitous ways and through this use, unlock their potential to engage in complex computational thinking. This will continue to build the impact of innovative technology in this rapidly changing educational landscape.   
									</p>
									<p>Apart from sessions, we believe that a video series can help students learn better if they are working on a Mindstrom. So here is a lecture, broken down into parts, where the medium of instructions is Hindi because that is mainly our target group, so that children can develop themselves also. Enjoy! </br> </br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKSlvbIJ7fbxDkPPUeujA3-22yBE-yS2Y" class="button special">Lecture Series</a> </p>
