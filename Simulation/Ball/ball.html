      <h1><strong>Drag and Gravity Ball</strong> - A simple physics simulation to help understand gravity, air drag and collisions</h1>
      
    </header>

    <p>The following is a demo to show how gravity, air drag and co-efficient of restitution work. Just drag the ball with the mouse and leave the mouse button to shoot it at an angle.Also, by right-clicking and "Inspect" you can change the variables in the script to simulate different situations. For ex. if you change 'rho' variable to 1.66, then the ball will behave as if it is in water medium! Similarily, the mass, radius and co-efficient of restitution can also be changed. </p>
